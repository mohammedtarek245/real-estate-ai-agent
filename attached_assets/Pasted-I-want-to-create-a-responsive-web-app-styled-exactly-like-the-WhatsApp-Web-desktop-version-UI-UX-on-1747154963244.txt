I want to create a responsive web app styled exactly like the WhatsApp Web desktop version (UI/UX only).

🧠 Project Description:
- The app is a **real estate AI agent**
- It holds conversations in **Arabic dialects** (Egyptian, Khaleeji, etc.) as defined in the backend Python logic
- The UI is in **English**, but all **messages (from the user and the AI)** are in Arabic
- I will provide the backend Python agent and CSV data
- The app will run on **Replit**

🎨 UI Requirements:

1. **Layout (WhatsApp style)**:
   - Left sidebar with fake contacts (e.g. "Client 1", "Client 2"), using generic avatars
   - Right side: chat window
   - Chat title/header = **"Real Estate Agent"**
   - AI messages: left-aligned
   - User messages: right-aligned
   - Message bubbles must mimic WhatsApp (green/gray, rounded, etc.)

2. **Greeting Message (very important)**:
   - When the page first loads, show an initial message from the AI:
     - Example: "👋 أهلاً! أنا وكيل العقارات الذكي. ازاي ممكن أساعدك؟"
   - This message should appear before the user types anything

3. **Message Input Functionality**:
   - User types a message and presses Enter or clicks Send
     - The message appears immediately
     - The input field **clears automatically**
     - The AI response appears with a slight delay (simulate “typing…” if needed)

4. **Performance + Bugs**:
   - “ . so add databases so the ai agent can use stored older chats or user messages to continue from last topic or question been asked not from the beginninh .Creating a database model to store the agent's state between interactions
   - Add a “typing...” animation while the AI is thinking
   - The AI response may be delayed due to backend logic — UI should reflect that

5. **Style**:
   - Match WhatsApp Web fonts, spacing, layout, and theme colors
   - Responsive on desktop
   - Clean, modern look — identical to WhatsApp Web
   - Avoid using real photos or names

🧪 Technical Notes:
- Must run easily on Replit (using Streamlit or Flask as backend)
- Must be easy to integrate with my existing Python backend file (`AI_agent_realestate.py`)
- You can use HTML/CSS/JS or Streamlit + HTML combos
- Contacts list can be static (no interactivity required)


🎯 Goal:
Investors should feel like they’re chatting with a **real Arabic-speaking real estate agent** through WhatsApp Web — powered by my AI agent backend.

Please generate clean, working UI code now.
